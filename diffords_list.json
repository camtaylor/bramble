Ideally, during the settling period, the glass should be placed in a glass froster/fridge/freezer. As the final contents of the shaker are poured into the glass so the head should rise like a souffle.\r Some Ramos Gin Fizz recipes, and indeed Henry Charles Ramos' original recipe, call for old tom gin (also our preference), in which case you may need to reduce the amount of sugar syrup depending on your old tom, personal tastes and citrus fruit."
