Place lamb on the grill, making sure the meat isn\u2019t bunched up in places and is completely flat. Cook for about 8 minutes, at which point there should be a lot of charring, then flip the meat over and cook for another 8 minutes. If the lamb is particularly thin (less than 2-inches thick) you may only need 5 minutes on each side. Insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the lamb to make sure the temperature has reached 145 degrees fahrenheit. Transfer lamb from the grill to a cutting board, cover with foil and let rest for ten minutes. When the lamb is nearly finished resting, cut it into strips against the grain.",
